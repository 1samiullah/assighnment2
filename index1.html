        Dindigul biriyani is known for its dark brown colour, mild flavour, and tender meat. The meat used in the biryani is sourced from free-range goats that graze the surrounding hills.
        
        It is made with local seeraga samba rice, which is a short-grained rice that is native to Tamil Nadu. It is then mixed with mutton or chicken, yoghurt, pepper, and lemon juice to make it taste amazing.</p>
