        <br><p>When you travel to Mumbai, you’ll discover the Bombay Biryani, a unique variety of biryani. Usually, it consists of spicy fried potatoes with mutton or chicken.

            These ingredients give it a sweet and tangy flavour that makes it different from other biryanis. Meat marination consists of basic biryani spices with an addition of green chillies, coriander, mint, lemon juice, and plums.
            
            Bombay biryani also has fried potatoes in it. The unique combination of dried plums and kewra water makes this biryani interesting.</p>

            The origin of biryani, a flavourful rice dish, has Mughlai roots. The use of rose water and saffron gives it its distinct yellow colour and special aroma.
            
            The blend of nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander leaves, mace, cloves, and cardamom, along with soft-boiled eggs and potatoes, creates a magic dish you just can’t resist. Also, adding raita can really take it to the next level.</p>

        <p>The next Biryani type we have up in line is the delicious Awadhi Biryani for your special occassion! What makes this chicken biryani special is its different way of cooking. It takes inspiration from the Persian cooking style.

            The meat, whether it’s chicken or mutton, is marinated and cooked separately from the rice. Each part is filled with a spice mix, like saffron, star anise, and cinnamon. They are layered carefully in a handi (clay pot). Then, everything is cooked together in low heat.
            
            This method may feel a bit tricky, but please be patient to get that mild yet flavourful dish. The entire process results in the tastiest Awadhi Biryani you could find.</p>
