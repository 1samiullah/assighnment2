            If we’re talking about Biryani, you cannot forget the classic Hyderabadi Biryani! This satisfying delicacy is supposedly from the Nizams’ royal kitchens in Hyderabad. It has a range of meats, fragrant spices, mint leaves, and Basmati rice. Worldwide, biryani enthusiasts have a special place in their hearts for Hyderabadi biryani.
            
            Among the most well-liked Hyderabadi Biryani types is the “dum biryani.” In order to prepare this dish, the meat must be marinated and cooked with rice in a special pot that is covered with dough and cooked using the traditional dum pukht method. After that, the pot is set over a charcoal fire.
            
            There are various forms of Hyderabadi biryani, including the popular dum Biryani, which uses a dough-sealed earthen pot for cooking. There is also a vegetarian option available for this flavorful dish.</p>

        <p>If you have ever travelled to Gujarat, you couldn’t have missed their special biryani variant, the Memoni Biryani.


            It comes from the Gujarat-Sindh area and is made by the Memon people. This biryani has fewer tomatoes and less food colouring. This way, the rich colour of the  meat and the  spices really stand out.Best restaurants near me
            
            It mixes the flavours of lamb, yoghurt, fried brown onions, and layered potatoes. The Memoni Biryani looks and tastes amazing, making it very tempting for your taste buds.</p>
